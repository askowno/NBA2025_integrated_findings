## Summary {#summary}

Ecosystem Protection Level (EPL) is an indicator that was developed and refined in South Africa between 2004 and 2025 \[REF Linda new paper and Reyers 2007\]. It measures the degree to which ecosystem types are represented in the protected area network. The indicator has been used as a headline indicator in national reporting since 2005. Protection level is determined by calculating the proportion of each ecosystem type in a protected area, and evaluating this against a biodiversity target per ecosystem type, with heuristics regarding the ecological condition of the ecosystem types under protection. Ecosystem types are assigned one of four categories of protection: Well Protected - biodiversity target is met; Moderately Protected - at least half the biodiversity target is met; Poorly Protected - more than 5% of the biodiversity target is met, and Not Protected if less than 5% of the target is met.

## Building blocks of the Ecosystem Protection Level indicator

### Map of protected areas

Protected areas are areas of land or sea that are protected by law and managed mainly for biodiversity conservation. Protected areas are vital for ecological sustainability and climate-change adaptation. They also serve as the backbone of the ecological infrastructure network, protecting the areas that deliver important ecosystem services to people.

EPL is calculated using protected areas, recognised under the National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act (Act 57 of 2003). The Act provides for several categories of protected areas, including Special Nature Reserves, National Parks, Nature Reserves, Marine Protected Areas, and Protected Environments. In addition, it also recognises World Heritage Core Sites, especially Protected Forest Areas, and Mountain Catchment Areas. The EPL indicator does include a narrow range of legally secure Other Effective Conservation Measures (OECMs) as contributing to meeting protection targets **(Figure 1)** and, as additional OECMs are evaluated and mapped across the country they will be considered in the computation of the indicator.

### Ecosystem targets

In previous national assessments, targets for ecosystem protection level in the marine, freshwater and estuarine realms were set to 20% representation. With the publication the Global Biodiversity Framework (most notably Target 3) a 30% target has been adopted for the NBA 2025 ecosystem protection level indicator. The targets used in the terrestrial assessment are based on species-area curves per ecosystem type (targets range from 16% to 36%) [@desmet2004]; these remain in effect for NBA 2025.
